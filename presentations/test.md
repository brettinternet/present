# Okay

This is test text here.

```js{1-2}{numberLines: true}
const a = 'hello yes hi'

try {
  something()
} catch(err) {
  somethingElse()
}
```

### Graphviz charts are supported

```dot
digraph graphname {
  a -> b;
  b -> c;
  a -> c;
}
```

This should be inline $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, is it?

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$
